homework
========

my first repo

useless.cpp is program,based on binary heap, that allows you to launch couple of processes you want at the desired time,
from just one terminal.
it should be compiled in executive file "useless" and it takes one file name as an argument.
File format is:
time1 name1 arguments1
time2 name2 arguments2
...
(last symbol is "enter")
